							<h1>s.e.a. of sepulchers</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/yoksel-zok-sNFjytWoJBo-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><br>i. part one </br>
								Sepulchers are 
								<br>	The most fascinating thing. </br>
								<br>Ornately draping over </br>
								<br>	The rims of death – </br>
								<br>As if it were a spectacle.</p> </br>
								
								<p> <br> ii. part two </br>
									<br	I’ve borne witness to </br>
									<br>	Several sepulchers </br>
									<br> While traversing the fringes of life – </br>
									<br>	One was my confidants – </br>
									<br> A contingent that seemed like </br>
									<br>	It would last forever, at the time – </br>
									Yet, I couldn’t be more wrong.</p> 
								
									<p> <br> iii. part three </br>
										<br> Humans are so complex to understand – </br>
										<br> Sometimes, I wonder if I am but </br>
										<br> An entity masquerading as one – </br>
										<br>	For that is how detached we are. </br>
										<br> I cannot tell if I am at the forefront,  </br>
										<br>	Handling the reins of catalysis </br>
										<br>Or, if the soles of my feet tread </br>
										<br> The weathering promenade – </br>
										<br>As my irises espy the jingled spurs </br>
										<br>In the distance of the expansive vista. </br>

							<p>
								<br>i. every </br>
								<br>Every time yellowed & orange foliage embraces the earthen vista – </br>
								<br>	Every time the Earth masquerades in a cloak of frigid white – </br>
								<br>		Every time the camellia blooms – </br>
								<br>			Every time the June bugs’ plaintive cries reverberate –</br>
								<br>Every time that first snow graces the Earth, </br>
								<br>	I think of everything that happened –</br>
								<br>		And everything that didn’t. </br>
								<br>ii. thing </br>
								<br>I once knew of a thing called Love – it rebuffed me.</br>
								<br>	Joy was another queer fellow – it avoided me after I hit the third grade.</br>
								<br>		Peace was a strange little thing – to seek for something that doesn’t exist.</br>
								<br>			A catch-22 of emotions. </br>
								<br>To all the things I never knew. </br>
								<br>iii. hurts.</br>
								<br>Every time a toddler scrapes their knee in the skirmish of fun and clumsiness – </br>
								<br>	And cries that “It hurts” – </br>
								<br>I often wonder what they mean.</br>
								<br>	Because whenever the rivulets of sanguine rush through my own appendages, </br>
								<br>The child of Sadness and Anxiety –</br>
								<br>	It doesn’t hurt – </br>
								<br>Not nearly as much as when the soles of your boots turned away from me – </br>
								<br>	Forevermore. </br>

							<p>
								<br>			i. grass </br>
								<br>It started with grass – </br>
								<br>	Perfectly trimmed </br>
								<br>In the unruly fringes of nature – </br>
								<br>	A natural dichotomy.  </br>
								<br>As the soles of my shoes </br> 
								<br>	Embraced the asphalt </br>
								<br>Promenade of elementary schoolgoers, </br>
								<br>	The grass – with its perfectly </br>
								<br>Dome-shaped morning dew – </br>
								<br>	Seemed perfect – </br>
								<br>As if nature could be naturally </br>
								<br>	Perfect – </br>
								<br>As if I could be perfect. </br>
					
								<br>ii. schoolbus </br>
								<br>On the serpentine paths </br>
								<br>	That the bus took to school, </br>
								<br>My close confidants and I </br>
								<br>	Would frolic in the threshold </br>
								<br>Of reality and dreams – </br>
								<br>	The words dripping from the </br>
								<br>Corners of our mouths – </br>
								<br>	Messengers of (in)tangible </br>
								<br>Dreams and whimsical sketches </br>
								<br>	Of an alternate reality </br>
								<br>In which we were animals – </br>
								<br>	Coexisting in an idyllic state, </br>
								<br>Possessing not even an iota of a qualm </br>
								<br>	Because in that world, </br>
								<br>Nothing made sense (conventionally). </br>
								<br>	And that rang bells of familiarity </br>
								<br>That I thought were long cracked & broken. </br>
					
								<br>iii. band-aids </br>
								<br>In cybersecurity class – </br>
								<br>	Which is a fancy name for  </br>
								<br>Learning how to make safe passwords – </br>
								<br>	My keratin falls like the drooping petals </br>
								<br>Of withered flowers – except, the vase is </br>
								<br>	The cold countertop of computers. </br>
								<br>I hear myself asking to go to the nurse clinic – </br>
								<br>	I end up having to wait until school’s over  </br>
								<br>For me to be allowed to go. </br>
								<br>	By then, my fingertips look like </br>
								<br>They’ve been the centerpiece of an art piece</br>
								<br>	Where love, blood, and hate are the focus –</br>
								<br>Red, disproportionately –</br>
								<br>	Yet, red all the same.</br>
								<br>My fingers end up wearing sheer gauze</br>
								<br>	For their Halloween festival –</br>
								<br>Except, it’s not October, and </br>
								<br>	The only thing that’s dead is</br>
								<br>My thoughts – masquerading under</br>
								<br>	The cloak of vigorousness </br>
								<br>While being as lifeless as a wallflower</br>
								<br>	Intrinsically. </br>
					
								<br>iv. bandages </br>
								<br>When I was in elementary school, </br>
								<br>	The letters associated with</br>
								<br>Bandage and band-aid lingered in</br>
								<br>	An ambiguous realm –</br>
								<br>They seemed one and the same. </br>
								<br>	Now, almost a decade later,</br>
								<br>Those two letters that set them apart</br>
								<br>	Make a world of difference.</br>
								<br>To me, </br>
								<br>	A bandage is one that</br>
								<br>Binds the wounds that other people</br>
								<br>	Can’t see. A band-aid can</br>
								<br>Cover up the sanguine sickness </br>
								<br>	Engulfing my fingertips,</br>
								<br>Yet, a bandage can’t do that – </br>
								<br>	It can only cover </br>
								<br>My emotional scars – that only</br>
								<br>	I can see. </br>
								<br>So, a bandage may not be </br>
								<br>	The most effective </br>
								<br>Coping mechanism. </br>
								<br>	With age, I realize</br>
								<br>That I need bandages more.</br>
								<br>	Yet, I’ll always need </br>
								<br>The aid of bandaids to seal up</br>
								<br>	The scars that nobody</br>
								<br>Else wants to see.</br>
					
								<br>iv. band-aids</br>
								<br>In third grade, I asked </br>
								<br>	For a band-aid.</br>
								<br>I got it, neatly encased </br>
								<br>	Like little Christmas presents</br>
								<br>But for fingers. Luckily, </br>
								<br>	I had both the green and </br>
								<br>	Red spirit to celebrate in (un)joy.</br>
								<br>		Red on my fingers</br>
								<br>	And green on my face. </br>
					
								<br>v. ruminations </br>
								<br>Every time my feet</br>
								<br>	Traverse across</br>
								<br>	The confined sphere of </br>
								<br>		My house and </br>
								<br>	I venture into the world</br>
								<br>		Of friendship, </br>
								<br>	I always get reminded of</br>
								<br>		My band-aids, and</br>
								<br>	How nobody else has them.</br>
								<br>		Already twice in a few</br>
								<br>	Weeks, a contingent of girls </br>
								<br>		Informed me that </br>
								<br>	My bandage was littering the </br>
								<br>	Hard bathroom floor.</br>
								<br>	My fingertips embraced the</br>
								<br>	Band-aids – a testament</br>
								<br>	To my resilience thus far –</br>
								<br>	And I made a band-aid</br>
								<br>	Cemetery outside – my </br>
								<br>	Open scars for </br>
								<br>	All the world to see –</br>
								<br>	Except, I put no</br>
								<br>	Obituary. The vestiges of </br>
								<br>	My tumultuous psyche</br>
								<br>	Litter the earthen vista </br>
								<br>	Like stars litter</br>
								<br>	The desolate sky with </br>
								<br>	That little thing</br>
								<br>	Called light. I could use</br>
								<br>	Some of that</br>
								<br>	In my life.  </br>

							<p>
								
								<br>[Context: Pseudobulbar affect (PBA), also known as emotional incontinence, is a neurological disorder that causes people to have sudden, uncontrollable, and inappropriate episodes of crying or laughing. These episodes can be out of context with the person's social interactions and may not match their emotional state.]   </br>

								<br>	i. step one: emotional (in)continence </br>
								
								<br>My heart has always been purple. </br>
								<br>	Not red, like everyone else I had known. </br>
								<br>	Purple – </br>
								<br>	From emotionally bruising itself. </br>
								<br>For in the realm of emotions, </br>
								<br>	I lack any semblance of volition. </br>
								<br>	Tears and laughter come at the whim –</br>
								<br>	Of my cerebrum. </br>
								<br>I used to think that this meant my emotions</br>
								<br>		Were rational. </br>
								<br>	Yet, is it rational when </br>
								<br>	A classroom full of irises</br>
								<br>	Meet mine when sanguinity </br>
								<br>	Engulfs my platelet-filled</br>
								<br>Appendage that throbs in </br>
								<br>	Reverberating rings of pain –</br>
								<br>Yet, all I can do is 	l.a.u.g.h.</br>
								
								<br>ii. step two: a thing called sadness</br>
								
								<br>	I have a toxic relationship </br>
								<br>		With a thing called sadness.</br>
								<br>	My visage betrays me – </br>
								<br>		As the corners of my mouth</br>
								<br>	Turn up in ostensible joy</br>
								<br>	When my heart is purple again.</br>
								
								<br>	iii. step three: i once knew joy. </br>
								
								<br>Joy is an odd one to me. </br>
								<br>	Instead of cheery smiles & laughter, </br>
								<br>I’m met with a network of rivulets</br>
								<br>	Watery trails that leave my</br>
								<br>Weathered visage besmirched. </br>
								<br>	I wonder what it would feel </br>
								<br>To smile & laugh whenever I ace a test, </br>
								<br>	Instead of the merry-go-round </br>
								<br>Of cyclic sadness that befalls me. </br>
								<br>	For this, I am always a </br>
								<br>Simultaneous dichotomy.</br>
								<br>	Laughing in pain. </br>
								<br>As if something that embodies</br>
								<br>	The essence of joy</br>
								<br>Could be convoluted into </br>
								<br>	An agent of despair.</br>
								
								<br>	iii. step four: (im)permanence</br>
								
								<br>	A continuum of thoughts – </br>
								<br>		Always, invariably the same – </br>
								<br>	Form a nucleus around which </br>
								<br>	My prefrontal cortex revolves around.</br>
								<br>Sometimes, I wish there was a cure. </br>
								<br>There isn’t. </br>
								<br>Sometimes, I wish I could fit in with everyone else. </br>
								<br>I simply don’t. </br>
								<br>Sometimes, I wonder if it’s really an affliction after all.</br>
								<br>It may or may not be.</br>
								<br>Sometimes, I wonder if I even have PBA – </br>
								<br>	Or simply the product of a series of formative years</br>
								<br>		Encapsulated in a glass mirror</br>
								<br>			Shattered in its fragility</br>
								<br>				Emanating the color purple</br>
								<br>					That spreads like a disease</br>
								<br>						And into my heart.</br>
								<br>The mirror of truth deceives me. </br>

								<br>		i. part one: orchestra(ted) </br>
								<br>	I sit in the back of the vast stage. </br>
								<br>		Not because I wanted to –</br>
								<br>	Because the echoing acoustics in the back</br>
								<br>Make it even harder to blend in with the other sections.</br>
								<br>But because, as the only woodwind instrument</br>
								<br>	In the orchestra, I was relegated to the back.</br>
								<br>I was alone – musically, physically, emotionally. </br>
								<br>	I wasn’t ever allowed to practice during rehearsal, </br>
								<br>Yet I was berated for missing a single note – </br>
								<br>	The kind of graciousness that enveloped</br>
								<br>Every off-tune note emanating from the string section </br>
								<br>	Into a vortex of deafness – </br>
								<br>Had eluded me. </br>
								<br>Across the vista of Monday evenings</br>
								<br>That I would spend, sitting quietly in the back, </br>
								<br>	Endeavoring to finger some of the notes, at least – </br>
								<br>	Readying myself for an all-nighter </br>
								<br>		To practice outside of rehearsal</br>
								<br>		From scratch. </br>
								<br>The walk back to my car was always miserable. </br>
								<br>	Even the ravens, crowing in the distance, seemed to agree with me. </br>
		<br>The moon’s embrace illuminating my path back home, </br>
		<br>	As I sought solace in a world of darkness of my own.</br>
		<br>A cycle of rinse and repeat – </br>
		<br>Of being belittled and forgotten – </br>
		<br>	Made the playing of an instrument </br>
		<br>		Seem poisonous to the touch. </br>
		<br>My fingers would recoil whenever the soles of my feet </br>
		<br>	Approached even the vicinity of the music stand. </br>
		<br>An instrument – </br>
		<br>	Which used to be a haven for escape</br>
		<br>	In my elementary school years</br>
		<br>		A cathartic sense of relief </br>
		<br>		That provided me a reprieve from the whispers</br>
		<br>				On the mulch-littered playground. </br>
		<br>	Which used to be my harbinger of hope –</br>
		<br>		My only way of escaping my frigid reality</br>
		<br>		Of the gossipping lips of my peers, </br>
		<br>			Who hated my everything. </br>
		<br>				Hated that I was new 	</br>
		<br>– I seemed foreign.		</br>
		<br>(my parents’ jobs made me move five times.) </br>
		<br>Hated my kind of melanin </br>
		<br>– that I looked foreign. </br>
		<br>(i was born asian-american.) </br>
		<br>		Hated my vestiges of skin –  </br>
		<br>			Which fell like dried petals of decaying flowers. </br>
		<br>		Hated my obsession </br>
		<br>			With a thing called Perfection. </br>
		<br>(i had clinically diagnosed o.c.d.) </br> 
		<br>				Hated how the words fell from </br>
		<br>				The corners of my mouth – </br>
		<br>					Jumbled and awkward.</br>
		<br>(i had clinically diagnosed stuttering.)</br>
		<br>			Their mocking reenactments </br>
		<br>			Of me – </br>
		<br>				Leave me to battle</br>
		<br>			The fiends they left me behind, </br>
		<br>				Thousands of miles away – </br>
		<br>			Yet, it is as if they’re still there.</br>
		<br>The continuum of lost Mondays </br>
		<br>Had engulfed my time like no other – </br>
		<br>	My double-jointed pinky finger </br>
		<br>		Screams in an (un)hearable voice. </br>
		<br>If only I could reach the lower register of keys. </br>
		<br>	But I can’t. </br>
		<br>If only the flute – </br>
		<br>	My only means of escapism </br>
		<br>Wasn’t a weapon of agony used against me.</br>

								<br>	i. prelude </br>

								<br>p.erhaps it is inadvertent – and maybe it is not. </br>
								<br>r.ather frankly, I do not know –</br>
								<br>e.ven if I did know, how would the symphony of sounds translate to the clumsy written word?</br>
								<br>l.ucid is my mind when encountering the dimmed lights – the red draperies concealing </br>
								<br>	The agent of music propagation, inside.</br>
								<br>u.biquitious are the people – jostling each other in order to skirmish for a coveted spot.</br>
								<br>d.id I ever glimpse the realm of musicality in my sphere of artificiality –</br>
								<br>	Artificial visage, </br>
								<br>		Artificial mein, </br>
								<br>			Artificial effusing of emotions.</br>
								<br>e.very time the soles of my shoes traverse the familiar promenade of shoes before me, </br>
								<br>	I oft wonder what would transpire if I had never been so emboldened to espy across the looking-glass, in a society enraptured by superficiality & artificiality. </br> 

								<br>ii. opus </br>

								<br>o.penly, music is an art.</br>
								<br>p.ernicious are those naysayers </br>
								<br>u.ntil we meet again –</br>
								<br>s.ometimes, I wonder if that could ever be me – up there in the kaleidoscope of sound and color.</br>

								<br>iii. finale</br>

								<br>f.uture me might look back in retrospect, across the vista of time –</br>
								<br>i.ndeed, my five-year-old playing montage of fumbling over piano keys</br>
								<br>n.ever did elude my ten-year-old flute panoramic view of viola & violin in the mix</br>
								<br>a.lways, I wonder if I can glimpse the faint shimmering of colors –</br>
								<br>l.enient is my fingerings wincing at the effusion of color & sight</br>
								<br>e.ffervescent is my soul, metamorphosizing from a stepped-on caterpillar to a brillant butterfly. </br>
